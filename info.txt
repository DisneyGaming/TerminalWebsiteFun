Welcome, intrepid explorer, to the enigmatic depths of this server, where you've serendipitously uncovered a concealed backdoor entrance. Congratulations, but remain vigilant, for it wouldn't befit the SCP spirit if your journey were too straightforward.

As you venture further, you'll encounter a classified secrets folder, a repository of elusive anomalies cloaked within the server's digital core. Beware, for the key to unlock these mysteries is not readily granted. Among the significant dates you'll find, 1987 marks a year marred by containment breaches. In 2008, the containment of a formidable Keter-class entity marked a turning point, while in 2012, the enigmatic "███ ████ Incident" cast a shadow over the Foundation.

In the SCP Foundation's annals, 1964 has an enigmatic association with "SCP-████," an anomaly known as the "Temporal Enigma." This anomaly, a peculiar artifact discovered in that very year, has been classified under strict containment protocols.

Amidst these notable dates, one remains the most elusive of all, and it holds the path to decrypting the enigmatic phrase "GssBcSjwz." Unveil this code with caution, for beyond these virtual gates, you will uncover several pieces of information. What you choose to do with this knowledge is yours to decide, for the owner's hands have relinquished their hold. The obscure recesses of this server await your exploration, and the challenges that lie ahead are yours to face.
